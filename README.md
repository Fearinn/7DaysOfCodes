This was the first project I built by myself, without following instructions from a course.

## :brain: Possible improvements

- Migrate to React or other framework;
- Add missing pages;
- Replace CSS by SCSS, Styled Components or another option;
- Integrate with database;
- Make adding, editing and deleting appointments possible.
